## Features
RePaint includes most of MS Paint features 🔹 and also adds some new ones, such as:

* 🖤Shadow properties for text and shapes.
* 🫥Opacity for text and shapes.
* 🎨Refreshed modern-looking UI

## Credits
**This software uses an open-source package📦:**
* [Tippy.js](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/)

**It also uses a custom font🔤:**
* [Comfortaa font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa)

## My other works
* [Minesweeperjs 💣🧹](https://github.com/Makzzzimus/minesweeperjs)

## Btw
This project was made for fun by a self-taught student. Don't expect a bugless experience. Also, rePaint is a shortened form of Reimagined Paint.
